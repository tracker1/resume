### Senior Software Developer
#### Runbeck Election Services, Inc.
Jun 2018 - Sep 2021
Phoenix, AZ (Hybrid)

**Vocem:**
Design and principal front-end development of this web application used for scanning and validation of petitions used by several states and local jurisdictions. This application’s UI/UX was commented during a meeting with the Washington Secretary of State, “that looks sexy,” which is high praise for an application in the government space and I took as a great compliment personally having worked long and hard to be able to present scanned documents as well as the markup overlays and interface features.
- Azure DevOps was used for source control, CI/CD work flows and managed deployments.
- Microsoft SQL Server was used for the main database and storage interfaces for the application. This involved heavy usage of Stored Procedures, User Defined Functions and the bulk of the application process logic on the backend was inside the database itself.
- C# (4.x) with ASP.Net MVC and WebAPI was used for the back-end API.
- React was used with JavaScript/Typescript and functional components using Redux with Fetch API to call to the back-end. MUI (Material UI, Material Design) was used for the bulk of web component base. This was started with class based components and higher order components(HOC) in 2018, but migrated to functional components and hooks as they became available through 2019.

**Auth App:**
Design and principal development of this authentication and role based access control application (RBAC) used by applications built at Runbeck for simpler authentication where a more advanced authentication platform (Azure AD, Auth0, etc) wasn’t already in place. This was used for internal application deployments as well as a few states and local jurisdictions. It was built with defaults to meet or exceed NIST guidelines with options to match specific needs as overrides. This needed to be able to deploy to embedded applications on hardware as well as state/local deployments and cloud usage.
- SQLite was used as an embedded key/value store. Adapters were also written to be able to (re)use Microsoft SQL Server or PostgreSQL server as alternatives.
- C# (.Net Core 3) was used during the development, including a difficult migration from Core 2 to Core 3 during development which was required for ARM based deployments. ASP.Net MVC with WebAPI was used here. The use of a KV interface enabled layered security for an optional encryption layer used with SQLite at rest.
- React was used with functional components using Redux (hooks) with Fetch API to call to the back-end. MUI (previously Material UI, Material Design) was used for the bulk of web component base. This was started with class based components and higher order components(HOC) in 2018, but migrated to functional components and hooks as they became available through 2019.

**Authentication Adapters:**
Authentication adapters for role based access controls (RBAC).
- C# (.Net Core 3) was used with ASP.Net MVC for various applications to integrate with Azure AD, Auth0, and Okta.

**Vocem Online:**
The first petition platform for online ballot endorsement used in the US for ballot endorsement. This was built as a pilot application and proof of concept for the City of Boulder in Colorado.
- The application and related services were deployed with Terraform on Azure Kubernetes Service managed with Rancher with source control and CI/CD workflows under Azure DevOps.
- PostgreSQL was used as the primary database store for this application. It was chosen as it is more portable, with relatively easy scaling options such as CockroachDB as an alternative deployment option while not being too alien to use vs MS-SQL which most employees and developers in the organization were already familiar with. It was deployed using Azure hosting.
- Node.js was used on the back-end with Koa as the applicaiton library in place.
- React was used with functional components using Redux (hooks) with Fetch API to call to the back-end. MUI (previously Material UI, Material Design) was used for the bulk of web component base.

**Duo:**
Auth App integration with this simple mail sorter with controller using an ARM platform.
- C# (.Net Core 3) for embedded Blazor based application interface with the Auth App mentioned above.

**Sentio:**
Designed an architecture for a new software solution to manage the ballot on demand printers used by several counties.
- The legacy solution was using C# with .Net Framework 4.x using a WinForms based UI and Microsoft SQL Express on Windows.
- The new solution would still be on Windows, but separate services from a user accessible embedded web based application.


**Tools:**
- React
- Redux
- MUI (Material Design)
